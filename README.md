# CS3516 Project 2: Wire View

## By William Engdahl and Matthew Spofford

The project can be compiled using `make` or `make all`. There are also other Makefile rules for debugging purposes that can be found in `Makefile`.

Run `wireview.out` with the name of the pcap file to open as a parameter. It can be found in the `bin` directory that is created during the compilation process. For testing purposes, please use the pcap provided in the `pcap-examples` directory.
